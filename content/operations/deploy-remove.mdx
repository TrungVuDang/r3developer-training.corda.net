## Deploy a CorDapp

To add a new CorDapp to your node:  

1. Build the CorDapp jar file: `./gradlew :module-name:build`.

2. Stop the node: Type `bye` in the console, or if it's deployed as a service then type `sudo systemctl stop corda` in your VM's terminal.

3. Place the resulting jar file (can be found inside the `build` folder of your module) inside the `cordapps` folder of your node.

4. Start the node: `java -jar corda.jar`, or if it's deployed as a service then type `sudo systemctl start corda` in your VM's terminal.

## Remove a CorDapp

Once you remove a contracts/flows CorDapp from your node; you will no longer be able to use the related states/flows.  
  
To remove a CorDapp from your node:  

1. Make sure that there are no running flows that use the to-be-deleted CorDapp: If the flow on your node is a result of responding to a flow from another node, the initator flow must be killed as well; otherwise it will be stuck waiting for your node's response.
  
    a. Inside of your node's termainl type `run stateMachinesSnapshot`; it will show all outstanding flows.  
    b. Use the returned id to kill a certain flow: `flow kill [id]`.  
    
2. Stop the node: Type `bye` in the console, or if it's deployed as a service then type `sudo systemctl stop corda` in your VM's terminal.  
3. Remove the CorDapp's jar file from the `cordapps` folder.  
4. Start the node: `java -jar corda.jar`, or if it's deployed as a service then type `sudo systemctl start corda` in your VM's terminal.
