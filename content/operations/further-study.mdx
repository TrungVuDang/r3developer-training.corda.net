## Changing the Notary on States.

There are certain cases where a notary change is required. For instance, if you are trying to add a reference state that uses a different notary than your input states; those input states' notary must be changed to match that of the reference state, because in order to use a reference state in your transaction; the notary should be able to attest that it is an unconsumed state.
Since (usually) you don't have control over the reference state, but you do have control over the input states; then you change the notary of the latter.
In order to change the notary, you simply call the `NotaryChangeFlow` which will collect the approvals (i.e. signatures) from the participants of the state.

## The Node Explorer.

Node explorer is a very useful tool that allows you to see all sorts of information about your node (e.g. installed CorDapps, finalized transactions) and start RPC enabled flows.
You can see a video about its capabilities [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cn2lhS8pjRs).

## FlowHospital.

The flow hospital is a built-in node service that retries your flow from the last checkpoint.  
Flows are sent to the hospital when various issues occur (usually for ones that can be fixed) allowing the flow to proceed once they are resolved.  
Before Corda 4.4, the [list of errors](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/node-flow-hospital.html#run-time-behaviour) that sent a flow to the hospital was fixed, and the developer had no way of controlling that. For instance, if a responding node was missing a CorDapp; a `ClassNotFoundException` would send the flow to the hospital, so the node operator can install the missing CorDapp, then once the node is restarted (to load the new CorDapp); the hospital will retry the flow and it will proceed successfully this time.
With the new release, if the developer “catches an exception” that they believe can be fixed; they can raise a `HospitalizeFlowException` to send the flow to the hospital, allowing to replay it from the last checkpoint once the problem is resolved.  
An example would be your flow calling some API; and that API has timed-out with its response, in this case the API server might have been down; and you want to replay the flow again hoping that the server is back online by then, instead of throwing a `FlowException` and terminating your flow.
