There are many important things to consider when upgrading your states and CorDapps:

  - Versioning  
  - Backward compatibility  
  - How to deal with upgrading flows that are in-flight (i.e. draining the node)  
  - Contract constraints  
  - Upgrading states and their related custom schemas  
  - Testing your upgrades  

All of the above can be seen explained in detail [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/upgrading-cordapps.html).
