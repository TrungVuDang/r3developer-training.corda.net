In the previous modules you learned how to create a CorDapp. You learned how to unit test it and test it from the node shell.

Now, how do you deploy it on persistent machines and have them interact via a _real_ network? That's the purpose of this module.

The goal is to get you from _the code works on my machine_ to _the code runs on the cloud_ as a proof-of-concept. With this, you can start experimenting and demonstrating to investors, who knows?

The goal is not to skill you up to be a node administrator.
