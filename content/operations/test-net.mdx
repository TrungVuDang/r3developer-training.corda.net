Corda Testnet is an open public network of Corda nodes on the internet, it provides notary and network map services so you can deploy your nodes on separate machines and test them in a near-production setup.  
You can read about how to join TestNet [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/corda-testnet-intro.html).  
There are also detailed steps to join your node (that is deployed on the cloud) to TestNet:  

   - [AWS steps](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/aws-vm-explore.html)
   - [GCP steps](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/gcp-vm.html)
   - [Azure steps](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/azure-vm-explore.html)
    
Corda also provides Prod and Pr-Prod networks; they have a special joining process, and fees to use their services (i.e. notary). Read about them on this [dedicated website](https://corda.network/).
