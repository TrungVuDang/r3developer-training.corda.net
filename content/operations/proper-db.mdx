By default, nodes store their data in an H2 database which is an open-source lightweight Java database mostly used for development and testing.
Nodes can also be configured to use PostgreSQL and SQL Server; you can find detailed instructions about the configuration [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/node-database.html).
