title: Spin up a VM
description: Or get your naked Corda up
slug: operations/spin-up-vm

Track 1, Docker: Is there a ready-made docker that can be used to spin up in Azure?

Track 2, provisioned VM: What steps to do to install Corda as a software on a VM via command-line?

Presumably, the db is H2 at this stage.

Add test net certificates. Is there an already CorDapp that allows to _ping_ remote nodes and confirm things work?

Where is the network map and cache? How is it updated? Concepts and redirect to fuller docs.
