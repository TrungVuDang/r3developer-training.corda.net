## Docker

R3 provides an official Docker image for Corda. You can find detailed instructions about running Corda with Docker [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/docker-image.html).
You can also watch an [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITMOiMzkX4I).

## Installing Corda Node on a VM

Once you build your nodes locally (using `./gradlew deployNodes`), you can distribute them to separate machines (i.e. VM's).
In order to do that, you can use [the network bootstrapper](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/network-bootstrapper.html) tool to generate the required network map files.
Once you have all of the files, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-nodes-across-machines) to copy your nodes to separate VM's.

## Network Map

Nodes within a network see each other using the network map. This is a collection of statically signed `node-info` files, one for each node.
Most production deployments will use a highly available, secure distribution of the network map via HTTP.
You can read about it in detail [here](https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.4/network-map.html).
