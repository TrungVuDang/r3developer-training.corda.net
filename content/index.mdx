## Welcome to the Corda Training!

Corda is an open source blockchain platform to solve complex business problems.

Permissionless blockchain platforms, in which all data is shared with all parties, are largely unsuited for businesses. Corda was designed to only share data with relevant parties. Corda is flexible and scalable and ensures a high level of privacy and security.

Distributed Ledger applications on a high performance, enterprise grade platform. That is Corda.
