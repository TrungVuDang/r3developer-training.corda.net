## [`RedeemFlows`](https://git.b9lab.com/client-projects/r3-corda-education-services/r3-course-project/blob/master/020-first-token/workflows/src/main/java/com/template/flows/RedeemFlows.java)

<!-- link for now https://git.b9lab.com/client-projects/r3-corda-education-services/r3-course-project/blob/master/020-first-token/workflows/src/main/java/com/template/flows/RedeemFlows.java -->

First, let's have a diagram that sums up this flow:

![RedeemFlows CDL](images/cdl_redeem_tokens.png)

Once more, let's focus on what is different.

What our issue **initiator** flow does in a nutshell is:

1. Collect the required information.
2. Generate the transaction.
3. Verify it.
4. Sign the transaction.
5. Collect signatures from all holders and issuers.
6. Request a signature from the notary.
7. Send it over to all holders and issuers.

Sounds a lot like the `MoveFlows.Initiator`, with issuers that matter this time. And all our move **responder** flow does is:

1. Sign the transaction.
2. Accept the fully signed transaction.

And this time, all parties are signers, no need to differentiate between signers and mere participants.

The following new design decisions were taken:

* The `Initiator` constructor takes a very prescriptive list of inputs, for the same reason that we did it with `MoveFlows`. All the states passed will be redeemed.
* Any input holder or issuer can initiate the flow.
* We created an unsafe, but `abstract` `Responder`, in order to demonstrate an example of action that can be taken at the node level to fit a workflow while forcing the developer to create a safe child class.
* This `Responder` flow is not annotated with `@InitiatedBy`, so that only a decisive action can enable the link. This does not prevent a safer child class of `Responder`, or another implementation entirely, to be later annoted with `@InitiatedBy` if so required.

### `Initiator`

The class declaration is unremarkable by now.

#### The fields

You will recognise them from `MoveFlows`:

```java
@NotNull
private final List<StateAndRef<TokenState>> inputTokens;
@NotNull
private final ProgressTracker progressTracker;
```
There are no output tokens, remember, all are redeemed.

With these fields, the 2 constructors will look familiar. The declaration of the `call` function too.

#### Generating the transaction

If you followed `MoveFlows`, you will recognise the same actions with regards to the notaries. Here too we then gather the distinct signers:

```java
final Set<Party> allSigners = inputTokens.stream()
        .map(it -> it.getState().getData())
        .flatMap(it -> Stream.of(it.getIssuer(), it.getHolder()))
        .collect(Collectors.toSet());
```
With the extra twist that we need both issuer and holder. If you do not understand `.flatMap`, picture the array equivalent, instead of obtaining a nested array (or stream), which `,map` would yield:

```javascript
[ [ issuer1, holder1 ], [ issuer2, holder2 ], ... ]
```
When we use `.flatMap`, we get a flattened array:

```javascript
[ issuer1, holder1, issuer2, holder2, ... ]
```
Creating the command, creating the transaction builder, adding the inputs, verifying the transaction and signing it locally should no longer be mysterious. Neither should be the collecting of signatures from all other peers, if there are any. Nor the finalisation. What is there new to discover?

With this, let's move to the `Responder` and confirm that it follows this rather simple choreography.

### `Responder`

#### The class declaration

Ah something different:

```java
abstract class Responder extends FlowLogic<SignedTransaction> {
```
It also misses the `@InitiatedBy` annotation. This, combined with the `abstract` keyword really forces the developer to think about what they want to respond with. So what is it that we want to developer to do?

```java
protected abstract void additionalChecks(@NotNull final SignedTransaction stx) throws FlowException;
```
This `abstract` function looks suspiciously like none other than `SignTransactionFlow`'s own abstract function:

```kotlin
@Throws(FlowException::class)
protected abstract fun checkTransaction(stx: SignedTransaction)
```
And with reason as we will see.

#### Signing the transaction

Indeed the first thing that the `Responder` has to do is sign the transaction, by, as usual, creating the responder flow of `CollectSignaturesFlow`:

```java
final SignTransactionFlow signTransactionFlow = new SignTransactionFlow(counterpartySession) {
    @Override
    protected void checkTransaction(@NotNull final SignedTransaction stx) throws FlowException {
        additionalChecks(stx);
        [...]
```
And as expected, the `additionalChecks` is called so that the extra checks by the developer can be added. Then we follow with our classic check whereby our signature must be required.

When the flow has been instantiated, and only instantiated, it is time to run it:

```java
final SecureHash txId = subFlow(signTransactionFlow).getId();
```

#### Finalising

A classic case:

```java
return subFlow(new ReceiveFinalityFlow(counterpartySession, txId));
```
By the way, if you recall back in `IssueFlows.Responder`, we did not have any `txId` to pass to `ReceiveFinalityFlow`. Does it matter? For `MoveFlows` and `RedeemFlows`, yes it does. If you think adversarially, you can imagine that the initiator could try to pull a bait-and-switch on you. It could ask you to sign a valid transaction, and then send you an entirely different transaction to your vault. That could have serious side-effects, especially if your responder flow interacts with other systems.

This is why we pass the expected transaction id. In the case of the `IssueFlows`, even if the initiator sent us a `txId`, it could be anything really, we have no way of knowing whether it means anything. So expecting the `txId` ahead of time does not decrease your vulnerability.

### Tests

Once again, the tests are pretty run of the mill. They check that:

* The transaction created is as expected, which includes:
    * Signatures
    * Inputs
* The transaction has been recorded in vaults
* States have been consumed in vaults

But before that is possible, we need to implement a concrete child class of `Responder`. This is the role of:

```java
private static class UnsafeResponder extends RedeemFlows.Responder {
```
Which unsurprisingly does no additional checks:

```java
@Override
protected void additionalChecks(@NotNull SignedTransaction stx) {
}
```
We then make it the default responder for 3 of our 4 mocked nodes.

```java
it.registerInitiatedFlow(RedeemFlows.Initiator.class, UnsafeResponder.class);
```
The 4th mocked node uses another child class of `Responder`:

```java
private static class SkintResponder extends RedeemFlows.Responder {
    private final long MAX_QUANTITY = 20L;
```
Which has a very peculiar extra check:

```java
final boolean lowEnough = stx.toLedgerTransaction(getServiceHub(), false)
        .inputsOfType(TokenState.class).stream()
        .filter(it -> it.getHolder().equals(getOurIdentity()))
        .allMatch(it -> it.getQuantity() <= MAX_QUANTITY);
if (!lowEnough) throw new FlowException("Quantity must not be too high.");
```
Yes, it fails when their amount is too high.

### Bored already?

Ok, we have seen a bunch of flows that do very mechanical actions. In hindsight, they take properly prepared information, then act on it as expected. When you get the hang of it, that almost comes down to _yet another flow_.

Indeed, `RedeemFlows.Initiator` and `RedeemFlows.Responder` were a bit boring. Not really boring, but well, what else did we learn that we did not already learn with `MoveFlows`?

How about we introduce some non-mechanical elements?

You remember that the `Initiator` is very prescriptive with its inputs. It wants an arduously exact list, and will redeem all of them.

1. What if you want to help yourself with finding the proper `StateAndRef` given simple things like `issuer`, `holder` and `quantity` to redeem?
2. What if you want to redeem a quantity of 100 tokens and you have 2 tokens instances, one of quantity 50 and the other of quantity 75? Redeeming one is not enough, redeeming both is too much.

So here comes the `SimpleInitiator`:

1. It will take simple inputs like `Party` and `long`, and will convert that to `List<StateAndRef<TokenState>>`.
2. It will take care of any splitting and merging (a `Move`) necessary to obtain the exact sum, and some change for ourselves, before redeeming.

_Simple_ is in reference to its eventual usage...

What it will do in order is:

1. collect the required information.
2. fetch enough states from the vault.
3. make a `Move` transaction if necessary.
4. keep the _change_ for ourselves if relevant.
5. hand over to `Initiator` the exact states to be redeemed.

Since it will create 1 or 2 transactions, it is declared as:

```java
@StartableByRPC
class SimpleInitiator extends FlowLogic<Pair<SignedTransaction, SignedTransaction>> {
```
That's right, it returns a pair of transactions, the first being the optional move, and the second, the redemption.

This flow is not `@Initiating` and it has no tailored responder. Instead it prepares a bit then passes it on to `Initiator`, which knows how to handle all the possible cases. Also, you will need to suspend disbelief when we use the vault as this is something we cover later. We marked as optional expandable panels the parts where you do not need to dig deep if you don't want to. The point here is to show:

* flow chaining.
* that other flows can be simple and use complex flows.

<ExpansionPanel title="Optional rabbit hole">

#### `StateAccumulator`

Before we move on, let's look at what _fetch enough states_ means. It means that we have a **maximum quantity** in mind, and we are going to accumulate **states** until the **sum** of **quantities** is equal to or above this maximum.

The purpose of `class StateAccumulator` is to assist us with that. It has our fields of interest:

```java
final public long sum;
@NotNull
final public List<StateAndRef<TokenState>> states;
```
And the function that accumulates a new state only if we still need to:

```java
@NotNull
public StateAccumulator plusIfSumBelow(@NotNull final StateAndRef<TokenState> state, final long maxSum) {
    if (maxSum <= sum) return this;
    else return plus(state);
}
```
If you look into the `plus` function, you will see that we cover the overflow case:

```java
@NotNull
public StateAccumulator plus(@NotNull final StateAndRef<TokenState> state) {
    final List<StateAndRef<TokenState>> joined = new ArrayList<>(states);
    joined.add(state);
    return new StateAccumulator(
            Math.addExact(sum, state.getState().getData().getQuantity()),
            joined);
    }
```

</ExpansionPanel>

#### `SimpleInitiator` constructor

It takes the simple parameters we mentioned:

```java
public SimpleInitiator(
        @NotNull final Party notary,
        @NotNull final Party issuer,
        @NotNull final Party holder,
        final long totalQuantity) {
```
And with this, it creates a vault search criteria:

```java
this.tokenCriteria = new QueryCriteria.VaultQueryCriteria()
        .withParticipants(Collections.singletonList(holder))
        .withNotary(Collections.singletonList(notary));
```

<ExpansionPanel title="Optional rabbit hole">

#### The fetch function

When you fetch states from the vault, you are limited to 200 states. That's a lot, but it may not be enough. In any case, we need to use pagination, and for that, we used recursion, whereby it will call the same function for the next page if we did not accumulate enough yet. The function is declared as:

```java
private StateAccumulator fetchWorthAtLeast(
        final long remainingSum,
        @NotNull final PageSpecification paging) throws FlowException {
```
And you can look into its body, but basically it:

1. fetches some from the vault.
2. loads the result into a `StateAccumulator` instance.
3. if needed calls itself recursively and adds the (recursive) lot to its `StateAccumulator` instance.
4. returns the `StateAccumulator` instance.

</ExpansionPanel>

#### The optional move transaction

As we go into the `call` function:

```java
@Suspendable
@Override
public Pair<SignedTransaction, SignedTransaction> call() throws FlowException {
```
We fetch the necessary states:

```java
final StateAccumulator accumulated = fetchWorthAtLeast(totalQuantity);
```
Then we see if we fetched too much, `accumulated.sum <= totalQuantity ?`:

```java
final SignedTransaction moveTx = accumulated.sum <= totalQuantity ? null :
        subFlow(new MoveFlows.Initiator(accumulated.states, Arrays.asList(
                new TokenState(issuer, getOurIdentity(), totalQuantity), // Index 0 in outputs.
                new TokenState(issuer, getOurIdentity(), accumulated.sum - totalQuantity))));
```

* if we did not get enough states, it has already failed in `fetchWorthAtLeast`.
* if we get the exact count, we do not move anything, so mark `moveTx = null;`
* if we get more than necessary, we do some merging and splitting. Notice that:
    * because we are the holder of inputs and outputs, there is no call to another peer, everything happens locally, which is convenient because there is no defined default responder to `MoveFlows.Initiator`.
    * the `TokenState` that we intend to redeem is at index `0`.
    * the _change_ is at index `1`.

#### Passing over to `MoveFlows.Initiator`

Now that we need to select the states to redeem, whether we had a `Move` or not:

```java
final List<StateAndRef<TokenState>> toUse = moveTx == null ? accumulated.states :
        Collections.singletonList(moveTx.getTx().outRef(0));
```
And we hand over to the proper `Initiator`:

```java
return new Pair<>(moveTx, subFlow(new Initiator(
        toUse,
        HANDING_TO_INITIATOR.childProgressTracker())));
```
That's right, we return both transactions, with the first one perhaps `null`.

#### Tests

Of course, you will also find tests for this `SimpleInitiator`, whereby tokens are issued, then fetched. We cover the cases where:

* we do not have enough tokens.
* we have the right count in the vault.
* we have more than needed in the vault and yet manage to fetech the right count.
* we fetch more than needed and make a split.

### `RedeemFlows` conclusion

This bunch of `Redeem` flows should have given you some ideas as to how you can child-class or compose your flows.
